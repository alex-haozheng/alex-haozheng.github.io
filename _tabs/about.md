#### Welcome! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>
<br><br>
My name is Alex Zheng (郑才豪). I am a 1st year Masters student at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" target="_blank">Manning College of Information & Computer Science</a>. I have received my B.S. in computer science from the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" target="_blank">Manning College of Information & Computer Science</a> and my minor in mathematics from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. 
<br><br>
I love working on problems in many domains: Graph Theory, Parallel Systems and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Networks.
<br><br>
I am currently based in Boston looking for internship opportunities for the Summer of 2024.
